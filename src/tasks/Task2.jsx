/**
 * User story: As a pet owner I can give a name to my pet and I can submit it.
 * 
 * Constrains:
 * - [ ] You should NOT use any useState in this component.
 * - [ ] You should use the <form> element.
 * 
 * Requirements: 
 *  - [ ] A text input field is present.
 *  - [ ] The text input field has a label "Pet Name". 
 *  - [ ] If the user clicks to the label, the input field will be focused. 
 *        (The label properly bound to the input.)
 *  - [ ] A button "Send Pet" is exists next to the input field.
 *  - [ ] If a user clicks on it, the {petName: <input value>} data will be send
 *        with the fakeSend method. When the sending is complete, the
 *        data is logged to the console.
 *
